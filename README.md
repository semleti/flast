# flast
General purpose framework to build logical dependencies.
  
# Goals:
- Build a framework to allow the implementation of any logical graph.
- Disrupt traditional programming to a direct AST editing style which would enable more tools to work on code.
- Make ALL the code compatible by allowing interfaces/conversions between languages.

# Usages:
- Creation of programming languages
- Graph editors
  
# State:
Highly volatile.
Ongoing development.
Do not use.
  
# Warnings:
- Will undergo MAJOR changes.
- No documentation/examples until it reaches a stable state.
- Highly abstract philosophical goals which might not translate to practice (they should, but theory and practice tend to diasgree :/ )
